# Unhandled Asynchronous Error in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js where asynchronous errors within an HTTP server are not properly handled, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code simulates an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) that can randomly fail.  If the operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but the HTTP response is not handled, potentially leading to incomplete responses or unexpected server behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous operation's `then` block to gracefully handle any errors.  This ensures that a proper response (e.g., an error response) is sent to the client, even if the asynchronous operation fails.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node bug.js` and refresh the page multiple times to see the error.
3. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
